1) FizzBuzz: Write a function that will count from 1 to 100, and for each count, if the number is an even multiple of 5 output “Fizz” and if a multiple of 7 output “Buzz”, otherwise output "FizzBuzz"

2) The value of 2^17 = 131072, and the sum of the digits 1, 3, 1, 0, 7 & 2 is 14.  Write a function that will take a number as input, raise 2 to the power of the inputted number, and print out the sum of the digits of the result.

3) Find a common dictionary -- an example would be the one at /usr/share/dict/words which has words with one per line -- then find and print the first 20 (by any sorting method you wish) words that are anagrams of each other, e.g. “dog” is an anagram of “god”

4)  Use the same dictionary and find the first 20 palindromes of more than 3 characters (if any.)  A palindrome is a word spelled the same way forwards and backwards, e.g. ere or bob
